### Preparation Workflow

1. **Enable 3D Print Preparation** in the sidebar
2. **Configure Parameters** (size, thickness, combination options)
3. **Process Meshes** - automatic optimization runs
4. **Review Reports** - detailed validation and recommendations
5. **Export STL** - download print-ready files

### Printability Assessment

The system provides comprehensive validation with scoring:

**Validation Metrics:**
- **Printability Score**: 0-10 rating based on multiple factors
- **Watertight Status**: Mesh closure verification
- **Triangle Count**: Complexity assessment
- **Dimensional Analysis**: Size and scaling verification

**Report Details:**

### STL Export Process

1. **Automatic Filename Generation**: Safe, descriptive names for STL files
2. **Optimization Pipeline**: Repair → Scale → Validate → Export
3. **Download Interface**: Individual file download buttons
4. **Size Information**: File sizes and total export statistics

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

## Integration with Vista 3D Pipeline

### Directory Structure Compatibility
The viewer seamlessly integrates with the Vista 3D output structure:

```
output/
├── {PATIENT_ID}/
│   ├── nifti/          # Source CT data
│   ├── scans/       # Scan results
│   ├── ply/           # Generated PLY meshes
│   │   └── {CT_SCAN}/ # Organized by CT scan
│   └── voxels/        # Voxel data
```

### Server Integration
- **Automatic Discovery**: Finds PLY files through IMAGE_SERVER connection
- **Organized Browsing**: Patient → CT Scan → PLY file hierarchy
- **Consistent Interface**: Matches NiiVue Viewer selection patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No PLY files found"**
- Verify the CT scan has been processed through the Vista 3D pipeline
- Check that PLY generation completed successfully
- Confirm the IMAGE_SERVER is accessible

**Performance Issues with Large Meshes**
- Enable automatic mesh simplification
- Use "Simple" view mode for quick previews
- Consider processing fewer files simultaneously
- Check available system memory

**3D Printing Preparation Failures**
- Ensure meshes are valid (not empty or corrupted)
- Try increasing minimum wall thickness
- Check that target size is reasonable for the mesh complexity
- Review mesh quality before preparation

**Visualization Rendering Problems**
- Reduce opacity if meshes are overlapping
- Try different view modes if one fails
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure stable internet connection for Plotly rendering

### Performance Tips

**For Large Datasets:**
1. Start with "Simple" view mode
2. Select fewer PLY files initially
3. Use point cloud sampling ratios <1.0
4. Enable automatic mesh repair only when needed

**For 3D Printing:**
1. Begin with single mesh preparation
2. Test smaller target sizes first
3. Review printability reports before export
4. Use mesh combination carefully with complex models

**For Analysis:**
1. Enable detailed analysis features selectively
2. Use statistics view for comprehensive mesh information
3. Check color analysis only for meshes with vertex colors
